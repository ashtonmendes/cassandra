= Inserting and querying

The API to Cassandra is `CQL <cql>`, the Cassandra Query Language. To
use CQL, you will need to connect to the cluster, which can be done:

* either using cqlsh,
* or through a client driver for Cassandra.

== CQLSH

cqlsh is a command line shell for interacting with Cassandra through
CQL. It is shipped with every Cassandra package, and can be found in the
bin/ directory alongside the cassandra executable. It connects to the
single node specified on the command line. For example:

....
$ bin/cqlsh localhost
Connected to Test Cluster at localhost:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.8 | CQL spec 3.4.2 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
cqlsh> SELECT cluster_name, listen_address FROM system.local;

 cluster_name | listen_address
--------------+----------------
 Test Cluster |      127.0.0.1

(1 rows)
cqlsh>
....

See the `cqlsh section <cqlsh>` for full documentation.

== Client drivers

A lot of client drivers are provided by the Community and a list of
known drivers is provided in `the next section
<client-drivers>`. You should refer to the documentation of each drivers
for more information on how to use them.
